title: Systematically Documentation
---

Welcome to the Systematically documentation! This documentation combines guides for both Systematically (the visual editor platform) and the TokenScript DSL (language reference) into a single, progressive learning path.

## What is Systematically?

Systematically is a platform for creating and managing design tokens—the building blocks of your design system. It consists of:

- **Systematically**: A visual editor (SvelteKit-based) with Monaco editor, live preview, and visualizations
- **TokenScript DSL**: A simple, human-readable language for defining design tokens programmatically

## Learning Paths

Choose the path that fits your needs:

### 🎨 For Visual Designers (App-First Path)

Start with the visual editor and learn the DSL as you go:

1. **Introduction** - What is Systematically?
2. **Quick Start: App** - Get started with the visual editor
3. **Using the App** - Master the interface
4. **Creating Tokens** - Learn to create tokens visually
5. **Language Reference** - Deep dive into DSL syntax (when ready)

### 💻 For Developers (DSL-First Path)

Start with the language and use the app as needed:

1. **Introduction** - What is Systematically?
2. **Quick Start: DSL** - Write your first tokens
3. **Language Reference** - Complete syntax reference
4. **Creating Tokens** - Token creation patterns

### 🚀 Quick Start (Either Path)

- **New to design tokens?** → Start with App Quick Start
- **Familiar with design tokens?** → Start with DSL Quick Start

## Key Concepts

### Design Tokens
Design tokens are named values that represent design decisions—colors, spacing, typography, and more. They're the foundation of design systems.

### Scales
Scales automatically generate sequences of values from patterns:
- **Linear scales**: Add a fixed amount each step (great for spacing)
- **Modular scales**: Multiply by a ratio each step (great for typography)

### References
Tokens can reference other tokens, creating relationships and eliminating duplication.

### Visualizations
Systematically automatically creates visualizations of your scales, helping you see how tokens work together.

## Cross-References

Throughout this documentation, you'll find:
- **App perspective**: How to use features in the visual editor
- **DSL perspective**: How to write the same tokens in code
- **Cross-links**: Links between app and DSL sections
