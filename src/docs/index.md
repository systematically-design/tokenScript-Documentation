Welcome to the Systematically documentation! Systematically is an app powered by TokenScript DSL where you write DSL code to generate design tokens.

## What is Systematically?

Systematically is an app for creating and managing design tokens—the building blocks of your design system. You write TokenScript DSL code in Systematically to create tokens, and the app provides:

- **Monaco-powered code editor** - The same editor used in VS Code
- **Live preview** - See your tokens compile in real-time as you write
- **Visualizations** - Interactive displays of your scales and tokens
- **Cloud sync** - Automatic saving and cross-device access
- **Multi-page workspace** - Organize tokens into sets or groups

## Key Concepts

### Design Tokens
Design tokens are named values that represent design decisions—colors, spacing, typography, and more. They're the foundation of design systems.

### Scales
Scales automatically generate sequences of values from patterns:
- **Linear scales**: Add a fixed amount each step (great for spacing)
- **Modular scales**: Multiply by a ratio each step (great for typography)

### References
Tokens can reference other tokens, creating relationships and eliminating duplication.

### Visualizations
Systematically automatically creates visualizations of your scales, helping you see how tokens work together.
